Not all chapters, nor all boxes within each chapter, have been completed.\r\n\r\nThe documents were recently converted to RMarkdown and some code was updated.  It is unlikely that the conversion was perfect, so let me know if you find omissions or errors.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
